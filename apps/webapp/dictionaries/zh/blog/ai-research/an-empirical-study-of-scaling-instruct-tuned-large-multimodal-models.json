However, most existing studies of open-source LMM are performed using models with 13B parameters or smaller. In this paper we present an empirical study of scaling LLaVA up to 33B and 65B/70B, and share our findings from our explorations in image resolution, data mixing and parameter-efficient training methods such as LoRA/QLoRA. These are evaluated by their impact on the multi-modal and language capabilities when completing real-world tasks in the wild. We find that scaling LMM consistently enhances model performance and improves language capabilities, and performance of LoRA/QLoRA tuning of LMM are comparable to the performance of full-model fine-tuning. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of higher image resolutions and mixing multimodal-language data to improve LMM performance, and visual instruction tuning can sometimes improve LMM's pure language capability. We hope that this study makes state-of-the-art LMM research at a larger scale more accessible, thus helping establish stronger baselines for future research. Code and checkpoints will be made public."
