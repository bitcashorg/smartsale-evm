One of the biggest issues with traditional currencies is that they are controlled by centralized entities, such as governments and banks. This means that transactions are often slow and costly, and can be subject to censorship or freeze by the controlling entity. Bitcoin, on the other hand, operates on a decentralized network, meaning that no single entity controls it. This allows for fast, secure, and borderless transactions, as well as greater financial freedom and autonomy."

This can lead to a loss of purchasing power over time, and can make it difficult for individuals and businesses to plan for the future. Bitcoin, however, has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which means that it is immune to inflation in the traditional sense. This helps to ensure that the value of Bitcoin remains stable over time and allows for more predictable financial planning."

However, as more people became aware of the technology and its potential, the value of Bitcoin began to rise. In 2010, the first Bitcoin exchange was established, allowing people to buy and sell Bitcoins for fiat currency. This was a major step forward for the technology, as it made it more accessible to a wider audience. The same year, the first Bitcoin purchase was made, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer, paid 10,000 Bitcoins for two Papa John's pizzas."

It has the power to democratize finance and banking, bring financial services to the unbanked, and create new use cases in various industries. Entrepreneurs and innovators should consider how they can use Bitcoin to create new products and services that can help to change the world, just like the introduction of the Macintosh computer by Steve Jobs change the way we interact with technology.
