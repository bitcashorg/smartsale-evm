Different blockchain projects may require different governance structures, depending on factors such as the type of decisions to be made, the stakeholders involved, and the level of decentralization desired. The key is to design governance systems deliberately and purposefully, with a clear understanding of the goals and the context. In other words, blockchain governance should be designed with its eyes open, not blindfolded."
