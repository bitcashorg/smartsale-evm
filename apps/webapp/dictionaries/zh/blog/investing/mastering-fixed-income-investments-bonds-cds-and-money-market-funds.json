Rebalancing involves realigning your portfolio's asset allocation to its target weights. For example, if a certain asset class has performed exceptionally well and increased in proportion, you may need to sell some of it and reinvest in other assets that have lagged behind. Rebalancing ensures that your portfolio stays in line with your original investment strategy and risk tolerance."
