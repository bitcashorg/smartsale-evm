Many alternative investments, such as private equity and certain hedge funds, have lock-up periods that restrict investors from withdrawing their funds for a specified period. This illiquidity can limit access to capital and may not be suitable for investors with short-term liquidity needs. It is important to carefully consider the liquidity requirements of your investment portfolio and align them with the lock-up periods associated with alternative investments."
