Meanwhile, my mother devoted herself to the bustling household, nurturing me and my two siblings. \n\nThis period led to a phase of stability, propelling us into the comforts of middle-class life amidst a city celebrated for its diversity and beauty.  From an economic perspective, San Francisco changed from being a global financial center to one of the tech capitals of the world. I’m fortunate to be from a city on the forefront of innovation."

Paul's grasp of sound monetary and economic principles, his resistance to banker bailouts, his calls for curbing profligate spending, and his opposition to the expansion of our already colossal national debt resonated with me. His critique of monetary expansion, specifically quantitative easing, and his advocacy for the dissolution of the Federal Reserve marked him as a beacon of fiscal responsibility and liberty."

Our united endeavors—canvassing thousands of doors, placing thousands of calls, and leading an extensive grassroots campaign in Iowa—resulted in a notable triumph for Paul, securing 22 of the 28 Iowa delegates for the primary convention."

Initially built on the Bitshares platform during 2015/16, we transitioned Bitcash to the EOS framework from 2018 onwards. Despite the utility of a stable currency, it dawned on me that only a fraction of people were inclined towards spending cryptocurrencies. The predominant interest lay in investing, holding, and wealth accumulation, rather than expenditure. In light of this realization, my current focus is on devising a solution to streamline the process for individuals to engage with cryptocurrency, enhancing the ease of entry and exit from this digital financial ecosystem.  At present, our leading service is a peer-to-peer onramp in Nigeria, which has attracted over 3,000 registered users in its beta phase. Moreover, we've developed internal DAO tools aimed at enhancing organizational efficiency, crafted an intuitive and streamlined payments wallet, and devised simplified decentralized finance (DeFi) trading smart contracts slated for future release. Over the years, we have assembled a robust and committed core team, complemented by part-time and decentralized contributors specializing in marketing, development, and infrastructure. Our goal is to become a paragon of efficient and effective organization through the utilization of our DAO technology."
